# reddit-react

## Installation and usage
To get this application running do the following steps:
- Clone the repository to your local environment
- `cd reddit-react`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`

This should open a new browser tab in your default browser set to `localhost:8080`.
I highly recommend using Chrome, as I did not test this application on any other browsers.

If you with to runt the test suite type `npm test` in the command line. 
There is currently only one unit test for business logic, as such logic is limited for the scope of the project.

Thanks!
